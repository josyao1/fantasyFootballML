# Fantasy Football Predictor Capstone Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for Fantasy Football for the NFL 2024 season. Using machine learning algorithms, the model predicts top players for each position and assists in drafting an optimal fantasy team. The project evolved from a website concept to a focused study on machine learning application in fantasy sports.

## Week-by-Week Breakdown
1. **Week 1: Initial Setup**
   - Understanding sklearn and Pytorch.
   - Preliminary research on key stats affecting player performance.

2. **Week 2: Data Analysis**
   - Data cleaning and processing.
   - Exploring correlations between player/team stats and performance.

3. **Week 3: Model Selection and Training**
   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA) graphs.
   - Implementing linear regression and random forest models.

4. **Week 4: Refinement and Evaluation**
   - Encountered issues with the initial approach.
   - Transitioned to using season's data for prediction and implemented Ridge Regression and Lasso.

5. **Week 5: Model Optimization**
   - Testing multiple models to find the best predictor.
   - Creating visualizations for final presentation.

6. **Week 6: Draft Interface and Finalization**
   - Developing a user interface for draft process.
